# 🧠 Workplace Activity Recognition using YOLOv8

This project focuses on recognizing and classifying **workplace activities** using computer vision and deep learning. It leverages the power of **YOLOv8n**, custom datasets, and model comparison techniques to build a robust activity recognition system for industrial and corporate environments.
